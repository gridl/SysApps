        The Science programme was started  to stimulate scientific curiosity among middle school children and to reach children in rural India with innovative ways of learning science. It also focuses on new methods that encourage relating science to daily life experiences. 
        Thousands of children are reached through science clubs, science fairs and community workshops with a common dictum - 'learn by doing'. Performing experiments helps students gain a three-fold advantage. They understand concepts, gain confidence and those inclined towards the subject can further nurture their talent.

   <div class="panel-body">
      <span>Sampanna Jeevan Foundation launched the English Programme in the primary education sector to enable primary school children to achieve basic competencies in reading, writing, listening, and speaking English. The programme broadened its reach by helping a large number of young adults who could not secure employment due to a lack of soft skills. Primarily their ability to speak and understand English. Thus began a course in conversational English for young adults seeking employment. 
          Both programmes have remained dynamic, and the teams involved continue to test new methodologies and delivery mechanisms. These innovative measures have helped improve the learning process for students.
