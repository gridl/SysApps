               We started with an idea which led us to help a very big population of under privileged children.
                Two motivational factors inspired us to work for them, first is self-realization about our responsibility towards society and government who are investing many fold more money than what we do pay to institute, 
                if we are able to repay which can directly flourish the upcoming generation then we shall consider ourselves very fateful in our mission to fulfil the vision,
                 another one is a scientific study which shows that the intelligence quotient is normally distribute our population which represents that it does not matter whether a child is born in a lavish house of a metropolitan city or in the ruins of a desert.
                  they may get equal intellectual power to do something really big, but due to the peripheral conditions the nourishment of the core i.e. the child are not so feasible which can make him/her to perceive actual interest and lead in that direction. 
               In the process our nation loses a really good person which can definitely work for uplifting and development of our country. 
               There are uncountable examples which are worthless mentioning here and well known to world, who belonged from such a low profile area but contributed a lot.
               In our country we have very good men power with good brain property but distribution of development is very skew and random in nature hence we took an initiative to work for society.
